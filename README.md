# Ghost Admin Ember Demo

This repo rebuilds some parts of the Ghost admin interface in order to serve as a decision support for the [discussion](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/2144) whether to switch to ember or angular.

It is based on [Ember App Kit](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit) by Stefan Penner.
